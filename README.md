## Week 1

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

Over the past few weeks i had forgotten to update my personal log of each week therefore i shall start thus far.

## Week 5: October 17
Our formative assignment for this week was to create a game concept and deliver it to the rest of my peers as well as Michael and Al. I had many ideas for my game concept but attempted to keep my ideas to a small scale in order to not over-complicate features that I may have to incorporate later on within the group projects that may penalise the group to take further time attempting to add such features and thus running out of time to complete a working prototype by the end of the semester. I used free assets that I sourced from multiple different online sources such as a forum for users to submit their own assets for feedback and also enable another user to download and use with reference to the original author. In future I will keep myself more organised and prepare a few samples of my own assets give the viewers a much better understanding of the art style I wish the game to contain. As for the presentation itself, I managed to use the allotted given time of three minutes up by talking about the different features within the game and how the user will interact with certain objectives and the overall player motivation.  I didn’t particularly find this formative submission too challenging as I’ve had plenty of experience beforehand of doing such pitches from my time in sixth form. One thing I will need to improve upon is my confidence while presenting my ideas across to the audience, this can only be improved by forcing myself into situations similar to this or to keep practising talking to large audiences.
