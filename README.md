# comp150-cpd

## Semester 1

## Week 1

Over the past few weeks i had forgotten to update my personal log of each week therefore i shall start thus far.

## Week 2
This week we were put into small teams to create a game and create a paper prototype of how it works and also how it will be played. I didn't have much input with this task as my team as i lacked to concentrate throughout this task. 

## Week 5
Our formative assignment for this week was to create a game concept and deliver it to the rest of my peers as well as Michael and Al. I had many ideas for my game concept but attempted to keep my ideas to a small scale in order to not over-complicate features that I may have to incorporate later on within the group projects that may penalise the group to take further time attempting to add such features and thus running out of time to complete a working prototype by the end of the semester. I used free assets that I sourced from multiple different online sources such as a forum for users to submit their own assets for feedback and also enable another user to download and use with reference to the original author. In future I will keep myself more organised and prepare a few samples of my own assets give the viewers a much better understanding of the art style I wish the game to contain. As for the presentation itself, I managed to use the allotted given time of three minutes up by talking about the different features within the game and how the user will interact with certain objectives and the overall player motivation.  I didn’t particularly find this formative submission too challenging as I’ve had plenty of experience beforehand of doing such pitches from my time in sixth form. One thing I will need to improve upon is my confidence while presenting my ideas across to the audience, this can only be improved by forcing myself into situations similar to this or to keep practising talking to large audiences. 

## Week 6
This week our team had our first stand up meeting for our sprint for the COMP150 pre-production task, to help us keep track of the remaining tasks to complete the assignment we were introduced with a Trello board. We will be using this throughout the next few weeks until we have completed the assignment to a standard of which we are happy with and also fits the brief. 

## Week 7
This week we presented our proposals for our agile essays. Unfortunately due to feeling sick i was unable to attend the afternoon lecture of which everyone had put forward their essay proposals. If i had been able to attend this then i could've developed a few more ideas and therefore improve my proposal to fit the brief more appropriately. 

## Week 8
This week we began implementing audio into code. This task proved to be more difficult than i initally imagined, i kept getting distracted by things around me as a subconcious way to avoid doing the work. I'll need to look at this lecture again thoroughly.

## Week 9
This week i have handed in the tinkering graphics assignment. Due to my lack of effort for this assignment i fear it may be reffered for resubmission as there isn't much content within the program/s. We took a look at Travis to assist us with our COMP150 pre-production assignment, i'm still yet to look at it in depth and also set it up. 

## Career goals
In the near future my future career goals are within the game development industry, preferably within the programming side of things. Many game development studios look for young, enthusiastic employees with knowledge of a specific language. By focusing on one programming language then this will further my understanding of such language and therefore will become more fluent and easier to write and read/understand. 

## Semester 2

## Week 1
The first week was an amalgamation of getting used to the 9am starts and also making sure i'd gotten everything together. The first week was quite compact with lectures and workshops. I attended the Unreal Engine blueprints workshop but didn't get much done as it was hard to hear Brian over everyone else. We had our first PO meeting this week and had began making progress on our game project with the BAs.

## Week 2
Most of the BAs seem to be fairly motivated towards the COMP160 game project, a couple of them appear to have done little to no work over the past week. I have taken a look at multiple Unreal Engine tutorials, i have yet to complete any of them. Over the next few weeks i will attempt to complete these tutorials and see if they could be adapted for use in the Comp160 game project. 

## Week 3
A couple of the BAs wish to change courses but are unable until the end of the year, i feel like this has affected their motivation towards the game project and therefore are proucing very little or no work whatsoever. The number of members attending the stand-up meetings are reducing each week, i feel like this will affect the motivation of the whole team if it carries on. 

## Week 4
This week i have been rather ill and therefore have missed a few lectures. If i keep lectures then i fear i will penalise myself in the long run, i need to ensure that i will attend every lecture i have in future. 

## Week 5
